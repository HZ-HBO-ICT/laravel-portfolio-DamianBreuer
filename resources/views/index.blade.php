            <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1><br>
            <h3>I am always using ICT or technology. And it only gets more populair.<br>
                That's one of the reasons why I chose to study ICT. ICT is getting<br>
                more important through the years. So if there is more ICT in the future,<br>
                there is more need for people to work in the ICT-business.<br>
                <br><br>
                I don't actually know if this study is the right study for me,<br>
                because this study is my second choice. But I spend a lot of time behind<br>
                computers, so I'm used to sitting behind a laptop for a long time. And I<br>
                like learning new things about computers, so maybe this study is the right<br>
                study after all.<br>
